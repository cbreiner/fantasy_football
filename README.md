## Power Rankings Explained

There are three types of power rankings:
  1. RAW Power Rankings - Found on individual manager pages
  2. Season Power Rankings - Found on the season page
  3. Manager Power Rankings - Found on the Ranking Page
Lets look at each of them individually:

### Raw Power Rankings

Raw power rankings are calculated per season. They are independent and give us a base number for the season. Three aspects are taken into account:
  
  1. Average Points Scored (~50%)
  2. High and Low Score (Measuring consistency) (~30%)
  3. Win Percentage (~20%)

The idea here is to look out how many points you were scoring and how consistently. Winning matters but not as much as overall points. If you got unlucky and scored 2nd highest points every week but always played the person who scored the highest you'd never win but you'd still have a really good season. For those wondering the formulas is as follows: 

{(Average points Scored x 6) + (High point week + Low Point Week x 2) + ((Win Percentage x 200) x 2)}/10

### Season Power Rankings

Now how do we compare seasons from one year against seasons from another? The main problem is that average points (a major factor in the RAW power ranking) change from season to season based on rules, evolving league play etc. This is where the season power rankings come into play. They will tell you how dominant you were in a given season aim to equalize so we can compare seasons across years. 

Simply we take a given Power Ranking and compare it against the average raw power ranking from everyone else in the league that seasons. This way in a given season about half of the leauge will be above 1.0 and half below 1.0. 

- A season above 1.0 and you had a good chance to make the playoffs.
- A season above 1.1 or higher puts you in the top 25% of seasons
- A season above 1.2 is exceptional.

### Manager Power Rankings

OK here is where we leave the realm of focusing on points scored and really start looking rewarding 3 factors.

  - Wins in the regular season
  - Wins and Byes in the post season
  - Championships

The thinking here is that while you could get unlucky in a given season, if you're a good manager the wins are going to come. 
Here is how we account for those factors:

#### Regular Season Number 
Regular season wins / League average winning %

#### Post Season Number
(Post Season Wins + Byes)/ League average post season winning %

#### Championship multiplier  
Your championship multiplier is going to be 1.x where x is the number of championships you've won.  
(1 championship = 1.1, 2 championships = 1.2 etc.)

**Math**  
So we add the *regular season number*, and the *post season number* together and multiply the result by the *championship multiplier*. Finally we devide by the number of seasons played and we have our final result.  Or:

{(Regular season Number + Post Season Number) x Championship multiplier} / Number of seasons played.
